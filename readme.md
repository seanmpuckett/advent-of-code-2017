# Solutions to Advent of Code 2017 in SAI

All 25 days of 2017's Advent of Code (http://adventofcode.com) solved in SAI.

Puzzle input is located either in the source itself, or in the associated text files.

SAI is a language that transpiles to Javascript.

If you like the readability and conciseness of these solutions, perhaps the language will interest you.

See npm package sai-language for more.

## Usage

    node advent [1-25]
    
Computes the solutions for that day's puzzle, displays the results as part 1, part 2. 

The code for each day's puzzle is located in a separate **.SAI** file. Each of these files is a separate object definition. The **Advent.js** file instantiates the object, which runs the code marked **Instantiate** in the source.
